#  Qt Front End (PySide6)

A desktop GUI built with **Qt** using **PySide6**.  
This front end loads and previews design files (e.g., **.svg**) and renders them on a canvas for user interaction and workflow steps like parsing into polylines.

## Features
- Qt-based desktop UI (PySide6)
- Load and preview **SVG** files on a canvas
- Modular UI blocks/widgets (easy to extend)
- [Add: zoom/pan, grid overlay, layers, export, etc.]

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+** (or your version)
- **PySide6** (Qt for Python)
- [Optional] numpy / shapely / svgpathtools / etc.
